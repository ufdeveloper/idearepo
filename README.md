###### Postman style OIDC debugger 

This awesome tool https://oidcdebugger.com/ lets you make /authorize requests to an auth server by providing a convenient way to plugin values for the various url parameters required by the /authorize url.<br />
In addition to this, the Postman style OIDC debugger will let you save requests. This will save you the effort of plugging in these values for different clients, redirect urls, etc. over and over again.
