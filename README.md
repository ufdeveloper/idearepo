Repository of ideas to work on (hopefully sometime soon)

###### Postman style OIDC debugger 

This awesome tool https://oidcdebugger.com/ lets you make /authorize requests to an auth server by providing a convenient way to plugin values for the various url parameters required by the /authorize url.<br />
In addition to this, the Postman style OIDC debugger will let you save requests. This will save you the effort of plugging in these values for different clients, redirect urls, etc. over and over again.

###### Splitnot - Notifier and Auto Add bills on Splitwise after a bank transaction

Using Plaid, you can set up notifications on your phone every time a transaction is made. Add a call to action on this notification to be able to add the bill to Splitwise. You can have smart features like, notify only on large transactions, which have more probablity of being a shared bill. Or, notify only on large bills based on the category, ex, restaurant, fast food, etc. Also, user can setup notification windows, like when they are going on a trip. Smart notifications avoid spamming the user with notifications on every transaction.
